<h2> How does these Impact my School/Academic Life? </h2>
  My strongest strait is Loyalty, Pettiness and Determined. My strongest emotion would be anger, I feel like I have anger issues and I do need to control it at times, and also shyness. My hobby is editing. How does these impact my school/acdemic life?. Well being shy makes me not wanting to do anything that has to be done with speech or talking if front of anyone. I am very petty, If you do something to me and that breaks our loyalty to each other or trust, I can be so petty you hate me more than you ever did but I try my best to put that away because well-..I go out of hands at times. I am very determined to do things because I hate procastination and that is something I have noticed I loved to do, So I always push myself to do this or that..I am determined to get back up on my feet even if I fall on the path to where I want to be.

My Hero is a member of a Extraordinary and popular kpop group called BTS. The person who I am speaking about, his name is Kim Namjoon aka RM.
I chose Namjoon because of his belief in the importance of self-love, individuality, acceptance and personal growth.
