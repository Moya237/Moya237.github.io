  <p><I> I could add a part in my life about friends, Removing friends and see how they affect you. Charlie is correct when he said who you hand around with will be a major dtermining factor in what your attitude becomes, in Highschool I have noticed that this happened to me and before attending college I did what had to be done between me and them. 
“Just decide what you want to do and then get started. That is one of the most powerful lessons in life.” This quote is a very powerful quote that reasonates in what I want to do after college. Whenever I would be asked what I want to be, I would tell everyone I don't have a clue.<p><?I>

<h1> Degree and Skill's I have acquired </h1>
  The name of the degree I am working towards is Bachelor of Science in Computing. Skills that I have acquired so far?. I honestly think knowing how to write html and Css would be a skill for me that I have learned. But that's just about it. Because Past modules that I did and ones that i'm doing now I had an overview of what to do already.
